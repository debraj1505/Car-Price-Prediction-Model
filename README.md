# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Overview


In the dynamic world of automobile sales, predicting the right price of a used car is both a business necessity and a data-driven challenge. In this project, you will build a Car Price Prediction model using Linear Regression, aimed at forecasting car prices based on various real-world attributes such as brand, age, mileage, fuel type, and more.
This project simulates a real industry use-case and is designed to help you apply machine learning techniques in a practical and meaningful way—making your learning portfolio strong and interview-ready.


Objective


The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the selling price of used cars. You will handle data preprocessing, perform exploratory analysis, train a predictive model, and evaluate its accuracy using statistical metrics.


Dataset


A dataset containing information about used cars will be shared in the group. It includes:

● Car Brand & Model

● Year of Manufacture

● Mileage

● Fuel Type

● Transmission

● Owner Type

● Location

● Selling Price (Target Variable)

Key Tasks

1. Data Understanding and Exploration


    ● Loading and inspecting the dataset.
   
    ● Handling missing values and check data types.
   
    ● Identifying correlations and data distributions.

   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


   ● Visualizing how features affect the car price.
   
   ● Ploting heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots to gain insights.

   
3. Data Preprocessing
   
    ● Encoding categorical variables using Label or OneHot Encoding.
   
    ● Normalizing or scale numerical features.
   
    ● Spliting data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80:20).

   
4. Model Development

   ● Training a Linear Regression model on the training data.
   
   ● Predicting car prices on the test data.

   
6. Model Evaluation
   
    Assessing the model using:
   
      ● Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   
      ● Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   
      ● Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   
      ● R² Score (Goodness of Fit)
   
9. Model Interpretation
   
    ● Identifying the most impactful features.
   
    ● Discussing the model's strengths and limitations
   .
    ● Explaining potential underfitting or overfitting issues.
